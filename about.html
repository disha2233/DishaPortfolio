      <h2>Hello, I'm Disha ðŸ‘‹</h2>
      <p>
        I am a passionate IT professional who completed my Diploma in IT and 
        currently pursuing B.Tech in Information Technology. I love creating 
        modern websites, solving coding challenges, and building real-world projects 
        that make life easier for people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, I have worked on portfolio websites, airline booking systems, 
        and hospital appointment management applications using technologies like 
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Django, and MySQL.  
        I always enjoy learning new tools and taking part in hackathons & competitions.
